However, our discount table holds the discount in parcentages and there is no start or end date. In general practice it is very common to have a start and end date for the discouns as it sould not provide discount for infinite amount of time. But, our use case is different. LLM uses the common practices, thus it fails in our usecase. So we need to add this to the \"Few Shot Learning\" as well. The correct sql query asn ans is stored for this purpose."
